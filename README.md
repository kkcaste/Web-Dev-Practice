# Mini Projects for My Web Developer Journey  
> I'm still at an **average level**, so these sites **are not responsive on mobile devices** at the moment and may have some basic code.

## List of what you'll find here:  
- **"My Groceries List"** [Here](#1-My-Groceries-List-Code-here)
- **"Clock"** [Here](#2-Clock-Code-here)
- **"Guess the Number"** [Here](#3-Guess-The-Number-Code-here)
- **"Random Quote Generator"** [Here](#4-Random-Quote-Generator-Code-here)

> **Iâ€™m continuously adding** new exercises and **updating** existing ones.

# 1. My Groceries List [Code here](/MyGroceriesList)  
![Screenshot of the index](https://i.postimg.cc/dQTtt3Rc/list.png)  
### Here you can create your grocery list (it can also be converted into a _To Do List_ or something similar).  
### You have **two buttons**:  
- **_Add_ button**  
  - With this button, you can _add_ an item to the list.  
- **_Remove last_ button**  
  - With this button, you can _remove_ the last item from the list.

# 2. Clock [Code here](/Clock)

# 3. Guess The Number [Code here](/GuessTheNumber)  
![Screenshot of the index](https://i.postimg.cc/Wzs9KhTq/gtn.png)  
### It's the classic "_Guess the Number_" game.  
### Some cool features:  
- It has an **Easy Version** (You guess a number **from 1 to 10**), and a **Hard Version** (The **_default_** version, where you guess a number **from 1 to 100**).  
- If you don't enter a number between 1 and 100, the page will show: "_You have to enter a number between 1 and 100!_"  
- It shows your **previous attempts** and also tells you if your guess is "**Too Big**" or "**Too Small**."

# 4. Random Quote Generator [Code here](/RandomQuotes)
![Screenshot of the index](https://i.postimg.cc/5yM0MWRC/randomqoi.png)  
### The interface is very minimal and you just have to click _anywhere_ on the screen to generate a new quote
> [!IMPORTANT]
> #### You can add new quotes either by hand (like I'm doing), or with an API that always generates random quotes like [this one](https://api.quotable.io)
